Using python, pandas, and scikit-learn libraries and performing statistical analysis tests on key features, such as cholesterol and blood pressure, we identified correlations with heart attack risk.
Applying machine learning techniques, including Random Forest and K-Nearest Neighbors, with KNN achieving an F1 score of 95%, our model demonstrated high predictive accuracy for predicting risk levels based on patient health data.
Distinguishing critical predictors for heart attack risk, such as specific chest pain types, high cholesterol levels, and exercise-induced angina, this will offer valuable insights for preventive measures and healthcare planning.
